# Resume-Parser-using-spaCy-deployment-using-Paperclip
Resume Parsing in Python 
Project Objective
This project uses Python's library, SpaCy to implement various NLP (natural language processing) techniques like tokenization, lemmatization, 
parts of speech tagging, etc., for building a resume parser in Python. And, considering all the resumes are submitted in PDF format, you will learn how 
to implement optical character recognition (OCR) for extracting textual data from the documents. The resulting application will require minimum human intervention to 
extract crucial information from a resume, such as an applicant's work experience, name, geographical location, etc.
